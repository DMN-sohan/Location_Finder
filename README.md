- Heatmap either using WiFi Solver FDTD or completely creating FDTD from scratch 
                                            pip install fdtd, try to use that

- SeaBorn to correlate heatmap to come up with lookup values

- IDK some algorithm to come up with new position using old position, old strength and new strength

- Ping dummy packets to find strength every couple ms and sync with latency of program

- Calibration at router
